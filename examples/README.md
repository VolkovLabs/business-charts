# Examples

## Introduction

This is a loose collection of examples (partially contributed by users) to show off the possibilities and to provide a starting point for further exploration.

If you have setup a cool looking graph, please share your example. Take a look at the existing examples and send a pull-request with yours.

### Static Panels

Some example provide a ready made panel to play with the graph. These panels require the [Static data source for Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-static-datasource/) plugin.
